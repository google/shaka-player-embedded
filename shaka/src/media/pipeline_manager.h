 * is in charge of tracking the amount of content that is buffered and whether
 * playback is actually possible.
 *
 * This type is thread safe; however if calls are made to this from multiple
 * threads at once, it is unspecified what order the changes will happen
 * including the order of the calls to |on_status_changed|.  The callback is
 * invoked without the lock held, which allows for calls back into this object;
 * but this means that another thread could make a state change before the
 * callback is completed.  This also means that the callback can be invoked
 * multiple times concurrently.
